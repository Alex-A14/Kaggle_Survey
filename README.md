# Kaggle_Survey

This project gives a short summary of the results of the Kaggle Data Science survey. Basic demographics are presented and the language preferences of data scientists are explored. Finally, a linear regression model is constructed to predict salary in data science positions. After experimenting with several machine learning options I settled on a simple random forest approach.
