# Kaggle_Survey

This project gives a short summary of the results of the Kaggle Data Science survey. The survey explored the world of data science and machine learning to better understand who is working in data science, what they're doing, and where they are. In this summary, basic demographics are presented, and the language/tool preferences of data scientists are explored. Finally, a linear regression model is constructed to predict salary in data science positions. After experimenting with several machine learning options I settled on a simple `randomForest` approach. The data used is included in this repo or can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017).
